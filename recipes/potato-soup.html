    <p><strong>Cook the Bacon</strong></p>

    <p>
      Cook bacon in a Dutch oven over medium-high heat until brown and crispy.
      Drain bacon on paper towels and drain most (but not all!) of the bacon
      grease.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Cook the Soup</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Cook the celery, onion, and garlic in the remaining bacon grease. Add
      cubed potatoes and toss with veggies. Return the bacon to the pan and
      cover all the ingredients with chicken stock. Cover and simmer until the
      potatoes are tender. In a separate skillet, whisk butter into melted flour
      until slightly thickened. Whisk in heavy cream, tarragon, and cilantro.
      Bring the mixture to a boil and cook until thick and creamy. Stir cream
      mixture into potato mixture.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Blend and Serve</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Transfer half of the soup to a blender and puree, then return to the Dutch
      oven. Season to taste and serve with your favorite toppings, such as
      crumbled bacon or shredded Cheddar cheese.
