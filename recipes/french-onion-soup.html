    <p><strong>Step 1</strong></p>

    <p>
        Melt butter with olive oil in an 8-quart stock pot over medium heat. Add onions and continually stir until tender and translucent. Do not brown the onions.


    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Step 2</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        Add beef broth, sherry, and thyme. Season with salt and pepper. Let simmer for 30 minutes.


    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Step 3</strong>
      </p>
    <p>
        Meanwhile, preheat the oven's broiler.


    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Step 4</strong>
      </p>
      <p>Ladle soup into oven-safe serving bowls and place one slice of bread on top of each (bread may be broken into pieces if you prefer). Layer each slice of bread with a slice of provolone, 1/2 slice diced Swiss and 1 tablespoon Parmesan cheese.</p>
      <p>
        <strong>Step 5</strong>
      </p>
     <p>Place bowls on a cookie sheet and broil in the preheated oven until cheese bubbles and browns slightly, 2 to 3 minutes.</p>
